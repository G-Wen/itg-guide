# Pad Modding for Arcade Pads

Over the years, players have found many ways to make their pads perform better using various methods. Pad modding is an important part of ITG and modern charts are designed with pad modding in mind.

### Countersinking Brackets & Panels
If you find yourself getting caught on the big, bulky screws on the dance pad then you can convert your pad to use flatter screws by drilling the panels/brackets in order to fit countersunk ones.

Another, simpler option is to simply remove your inner brackets and screws and attach your centre panel using double sided tape. This is incredibly lazy, but doesn't require you to use power tools or buy new screws.

### Bracketless conversions

Ashley P. sells kits to convert your pad to her bracketless panels, so you can do away with brackets all together.

To buy these, join her [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/777175613046481/) then DM her or Adam Kirby to let you in. She also sells replacement DDR panels in this Facebook group.

### Using tape for increased sensitivity on arcade sensors

**TL;DR**
- Add gorilla and masking tape above the L bracket for height. 
- Add an insert below the L bracket for sensitivity. These are typically made by rolling a piece of tape over itself until the desired thickness is achieved.
- Leave just either the inner sensor or the two side sensors plugged in. (Relative to the centre panel)
	- Using side sensors typically give much more sensitivity than the inner sensor, which may be desirable for stamina.

### Converting an arcade pad to USB

There are many drop-in solutions for converting your arcade dance pad to USB. The best option in my opinion is TJ's STAC Board, which converts your pad to USB and also keeps light support.

Buy one here for ~$80: [https://icedragon.io/stac/](https://icedragon.io/stac/)

### Converting the pad to use FSR sensors instead of arcade sensors
Many people have been converting their pads to FSR's, which are analog sensors that hook up to an Arduino you can connect to your computer. They take some work to get setup properly but have many benefits.

There is a fair amount of technical knowledge required for FSR modding, and if you don't want to deal with it then I would suggest sticking to arcade sensors.
