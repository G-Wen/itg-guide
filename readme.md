# ITG Resource Guide & FAQ

There are a lot of great informational resources scattered around the ITG community and I wanted to throw them onto one page.

## What is "ITG" in 2021?
Originally, "In the Groove" was a 4-panel dance game created by Roxor Games. It ran on a modified Stepmania 3.95 engine and introduced features such as mines and hands.

Obviously, nobody plays the original arcade games anymore, and the game has mostly moved to the home audience especially after the pandemic. Modern "ITG" is considered as Stepmania 5 or OpenITG running a theme such as [Simply Love](https://github.com/Simply-Love/Simply-Love-SM5), [Digital Dance](https://github.com/Hayoreo/Digital-Dance), or [Waterfall](https://twitter.com/SteveReen/status/1392057636518973442) using ITG's original lifebar and scoring mechanics.

## What pad do I buy?
Dom has made a great video  listing off a bunch of pads: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEWj2_BNG_0

**TL;DR**
 - [L-TEK](https://www.maty-taneczne.pl/)
	 - Affordable hard pads, great  for all around play.
	 - Do the [penny mod](https://youtu.be/hLlBETbFACA) for additional sensitivity.
 - [StepManiaX](https://stepmaniax.com/)
	 - High-end, arcade-grade pads but are extremely difficult to get due to low supply and high demand.
	 - If you play stamina, you might run into issues with triggering accidental decents/way offs ("the boys")
 -  Purchasing an arcade machine/pads is usually the best option if you can.
	 - Search Craigslist, arcade buy/sell Facebook groups, Kijiji, etc.
	 - Cabs can be converted to Stepmania fairly easily, see [JeffreyATW's Guide](https://jeffreyatw.com/blog/2019/08/how-to-convert-a-ddr-cabinet-for-stepmania/) here.
 - Other pads like Anton's travel pads are good options too.
 - DDRGame and Precision Dance Pads suck. Buyer beware.

There are also great DIY pad options available which I will cover in a different section.
