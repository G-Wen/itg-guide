# ITG Resource Guide & FAQ

There are a lot of great informational resources scattered around the ITG community and I wanted to throw them onto one page.

## What is In The Groove (ITG) in 2021?
Originally, [In the Groove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Groove_(video_game)) (ITG) was a 4-panel dance game created by Roxor Games based on the earlier (and much more popular) Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) game by Konami. ITG ran on a modified Stepmania 3.95 engine (an open source clone of DDR) and introduced features such as mines and hands and support for "mod charts". ITG was sold as a PS2 game, an upgrade kit for existing DDR cabinets, and as an ITG dedicated cabinet (dedicab). Shortly after ITG gained popularity, it got into [legal trouble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Corp._v._Roxor_Games_Inc.) with Konami and it went away in an official capacity. At this point in time, people refer to people who play Stepmania on a pad (as opposed to a keyboard) as "ITG".

Few play the original arcade games anymore, and the game has mostly moved to the home audience especially after the pandemic. Modern "ITG" is considered as Stepmania 5 or OpenITG running a theme such as [Simply Love](https://github.com/Simply-Love/Simply-Love-SM5), [Digital Dance](https://github.com/Hayoreo/Digital-Dance), or [Waterfall](https://twitter.com/SteveReen/status/1392057636518973442) using ITG's original lifebar and scoring mechanics.

There are several playstyles of ITG:
- FA
- Tech
- Stamina/Footspeed

## What pad do I buy?
Dom has made a great video listing and reviewing many different pads: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEWj2_BNG_0

**TL;DR**
 - [L-TEK](https://www.maty-taneczne.pl/)
	 - Affordable hard pads, great  for all around play.
	 - Do the [penny mod](https://youtu.be/hLlBETbFACA) for additional sensitivity.
	 - The optional bar is not worth the money, it is wobbly and expensive. See [Roujo's bar building guide](https://roujo.toepi.moe/dance/bar-building-guide) on how to build your own for much cheaper.
 - [StepManiaX](https://stepmaniax.com/)
	 - These are high-end, arcade-grade pads but are extremely difficult to get due to low supply and high demand.
	 - If you play stamina, you might run into issues with triggering accidental decents/way offs ("the boys").
	 - Don't buy the earlier generation pads using the load cell sensors, they suck. Go for the newer ones that have FSR sensors.
 -  Purchasing an arcade machine/pads is usually the best option if you can find one.
	 - Search Craigslist, arcade buy/sell Facebook groups, Kijiji, etc.
	 - Cabs can be converted to Stepmania fairly easily, see [JeffreyATW's Guide](https://jeffreyatw.com/blog/2019/08/how-to-convert-a-ddr-cabinet-for-stepmania/) here.
	 - Single pads can be converted to USB with either FSR's or a STAC Board. I will touch more on this in the pad modding section. 
 - Other pads like Anton's travel pads are good options too.
 - DDRGame and Precision Dance Pads suck. Buyer beware.

There are also great DIY pad options available which I will cover in a different section.
 
## DIY Pads
Lately, there have been tons of advancements in DIY pad building and people have made affordable pads that are easy to build and perform well.

**4199's Epic Velostat Pad (~$20)**

![!4199's pad](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h3qDn847Iio/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLCJ-_obv35i-e43KpktNzxSe1ANHQ)

This is a pad that 4199 made out of parts he had laying around. It's probably awful to play on but hella cheap and [he managed to pass a 20 on it, somehow.](https://youtu.be/9uK49TieQUQ) Watch his on guide on building one [here](https://youtu.be/h3qDn847Iio).

**Plywood FSR Travel Pad (~$100)**

![Bandit's pad](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y6wGYLE0YI4/hq720.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCOgCEMoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLBpNh0yAZkWAYPRqQobuIOAxCYL0g)

Take a piece of plywood, slap some FSR's on it and call it a day. [yutsi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mskaXrFsebA) is a stamina player who uses one of these and is able to 20's on it. Watch Bandit's guide on how to [Build This Pad.](https://youtu.be/y6wGYLE0YI4)

**Other pads I don't know much about:**
 - Dom has a [ten-part video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2vUwLUVuyIy4CD8DEwS7oZ_Y41vyYWWy) on how he built a custom pad using used arcade parts. 
 - [Re:Flex pads](https://reflex.dance/) are an open source, arcade-grade pad created by Brittany.
 - [Mystic pads](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mb6kjM13b7gjBU2B5ZLw1kvVDJ5bW0qdI1sw27WHaKk/edit?usp=sharing) are also an open source, arcade-grade pad.
