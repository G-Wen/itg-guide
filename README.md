# ITG Resource Guide & FAQ

There are a lot of great informational resources scattered around the ITG community and I wanted to throw them onto one page.

## What is In The Groove (ITG) in 2021?
Originally, [In the Groove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Groove_(video_game)) (ITG) was a 4-panel dance game created by Roxor Games based on the earlier (and much more popular) Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) game by Konami. ITG ran on a modified Stepmania 3.95 engine (an open source clone of DDR) and introduced features such as mines and hands and support for "mod charts". ITG was sold as a PS2 game, an upgrade kit for existing DDR cabinets, and as an ITG dedicated cabinet (dedicab). Shortly after ITG gained popularity, it got into [legal trouble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Corp._v._Roxor_Games_Inc.) with Konami and it went away in an official capacity. At this point in time, people refer to people who play Stepmania on a pad (as opposed to a keyboard) as "ITG".

Few play the original arcade games anymore, and the game has mostly moved to the home audience especially after the pandemic. Modern "ITG" is considered as Stepmania 5 or OpenITG running a theme such as [Simply Love](https://github.com/Simply-Love/Simply-Love-SM5), [Digital Dance](https://github.com/Hayoreo/Digital-Dance), or [Waterfall](https://twitter.com/SteveReen/status/1392057636518973442) using ITG's original lifebar and scoring mechanics.

There are several playstyles of ITG:
- FA
- Tech
- Stamina/Footspeed

## What pad do I buy?
Dom has made a great video  listing off a bunch of pads: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEWj2_BNG_0

**TL;DR**
 - [L-TEK](https://www.maty-taneczne.pl/)
	 - Affordable hard pads, great  for all around play.
	 - Do the [penny mod](https://youtu.be/hLlBETbFACA) for additional sensitivity.
 - [StepManiaX](https://stepmaniax.com/)
	 - High-end, arcade-grade pads but are extremely difficult to get due to low supply and high demand.
	 - If you play stamina, you might run into issues with triggering accidental decents/way offs ("the boys")
 -  Purchasing an arcade machine/pads is usually the best option if you can.
	 - Search Craigslist, arcade buy/sell Facebook groups, Kijiji, etc.
	 - Cabs can be converted to Stepmania fairly easily, see [JeffreyATW's Guide](https://jeffreyatw.com/blog/2019/08/how-to-convert-a-ddr-cabinet-for-stepmania/) here.
 - Other pads like Anton's travel pads are good options too.
 - DDRGame and Precision Dance Pads suck. Buyer beware.

There are also great DIY pad options available which I will cover in a different section.
