**TL;DR**
1. Download and install [Stepmania 5.0.12](https://www.stepmania.com/download/), [Stepmania 5.1 Beta 2](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/releases/tag/v5.1.0-b2), or [ Project Outfox 5.3 Beta](https://projectmoon.dance/)
2. Get [Simply Love](https://github.com/Simply-Love/Simply-Love-SM5), [Digital Dance](https://github.com/Hayoreo/Digital-Dance), or [Waterfall](https://twitter.com/SteveReen/status/1392057636518973442) and put them in Stepmania's Themes folder
3. Switch to the theme in the "Appearance" section in the Stepmania options
4. You now have ITG!

I have not personally used it before, but the [Club Fantastic Installer](https://wiki.clubfantastic.dance/) will set up Stepmania 5 for you with the Club Fantastic theme + base song pack.

**Some places to get songs**
